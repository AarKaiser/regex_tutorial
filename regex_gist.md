# A Brief Introduction to Regex

"Regex" is a portmanteau of the words "regular" and "expression," and refers to a set of strings used to create patterns that assist in the matching, locating and management of text. They are accessible in a wide-range of applicatons ranging from the command line, to text-editors, and have made complex functions otherwise required for the same functionality redundant. Created in 1951 by mathematician [Stephen Cole Kleene](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Cole-Kleene), Regex entered popular use in 1968 after being popularized by text-editors and compilers. It is now a common concept in programming and development, where it has considerably shortened the ammount of code required to achieve the same task.

In this brief introduction to Regex, we will cover a specific example in order to facilitate grasping both the usefulness and concept behind Regex.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
